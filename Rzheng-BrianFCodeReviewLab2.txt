Hey Brian, your form is very well made and neatly laid out. One small thing I noticed is that the primary key (ID) appears to show an index of -1 when a new row is added.
This doesn’t break the application or affect functionality, but from a user perspective, it might be clearer if the indexing + 1 instead.

One thing we did do similarly was that we mainly used SQL in the cityTableAdpater and our queries look very similar. A minor thing would be to add more comments to your code. I only saw the default comments that visual studio would leave.
Anotherthing would be to string mask the population total, shown by clicking the "Get Population" button, with the appropriate commas. For example, 100000 would be 100,000. 

Lastly, I might be misunderstanding something, but I saw the cityBindingNavigatorSaveItem_Click event. I belived that the code inside the method is to update changes made from the grid to the database.
 However, when I do make a change whether it's updating a field, deleting a row or inserting one, it does not save the changes.

But overall, great job!
